<!-- Programming for Web Pages: 
Every application will need to gather info from a user, and most common way to do that in JS is through a web page.
Also we would want to display output to a user through a web page. Now we can start working with HTML5 tags.
We'll start by setting up a web page. We'll add a few basic elements and we'll see what we need to do to access these elements in JS.
Next we'll go to JS and we'll see how to change some text on the web page.
Next we'll have buttons on our web page, but we want to know when those buttons get clicked.
We'll see how to handle a button click using what's called an event handler.
Next we'll see how to remove and add elements to a web page, and we'll wrap up the module by adding a user interface to our Blackjack

Setting up a Web Page:
DOM: Document Object Model: Defines how the data of a web page is organised and manipulated.
Document refers to a web page, an HTML file. A model refers to the data that we use in any program.
We store our data most of the time in an object, so that's the object model. So you'll hear this term DOM, often. 
JS developers will refer a web page as the DOM as mostly interested in working with objects. -->
